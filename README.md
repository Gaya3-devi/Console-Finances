# Console Finances


## Overview
 
This activity presents a real-world situation, I have used JavaScript skills to create code for analyzing the financial records of a company. 

This code analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

* Printing the above analysis to the console.
